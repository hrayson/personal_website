title: Perception of facial cues in early development
summary: Developmental EEG and eye-tracking research on the perception of facial cues (facial expressions and gaze shifts) in infants and young children, in humans and non-human primates. The studies focus on how sensorimotor representations develop in the infant brain, including the role of early social experience, and how atypical early attention biases to facial expressions may increase risk for socioemotional problems. Supported by a Medical Research Council Studentship and Marie Curie Individual Fellowship.
