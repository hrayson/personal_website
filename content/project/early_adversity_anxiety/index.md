title: Longitudinal effects of early social adversity on brain and behaviour
summary: This is a longitudinal project focused on the long-term effects of early social adversity on social, affective, cognitive, and behavioural outcomes in macaques, and the neurobiological mechanisms underlying these relationships. Naturalistic observation, structured behavioural tasks, and MRI (anatomical, diffusion, rs-functional) are being utlized to assess brain and behavioural development from pre-puberty, across adolescence, into early adulthood.

Longitudinal assessment (naturalistic observation, stuctured behavioural tasks, MRI) of the effects of early adversity on socio-affective, cognitive and behavioural development in macaques. The project is supported by funding from the Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR-19-CE37-0023), the Fondation de France (No. 00079331), the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (P01HD064653), and the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie (No. 841210).
