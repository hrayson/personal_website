abstract: Temporal dynamics of behavior, particularly facial expressions, are fundamental for communication between individuals from very early in development. Facial expression processing has been widely demonstrated to involve embodied simulative processes mediated by the motor system. Such processes may be impaired in patients with congenital facial palsy, including those affected by Moebius syndrome (MBS). The aims of this study were to investigate (a) the role of motor mechanisms in the processing of dynamic facial expression timing by testing patients affected by congenital facial palsy and (b) age-dependent effects on such processing. Accordingly, we recruited 38 typically developing individuals and 15 individuals with MBS, ranging in age from childhood to adulthood. We used a time comparison task where participants were asked to identify which one of two dynamic facial expressions was faster. Results showed that MBS individuals performed worse than controls in correctly estimating the duration of facial expressions. Interestingly, we did not find any performance differences in relation to age. These findings provide further evidence for the involvement of the motor system in processing facial expression duration and suggest that a sensorimotor matching mechanism may contribute to such timing perception from childhood.
