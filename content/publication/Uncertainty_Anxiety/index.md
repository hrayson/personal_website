abstract: Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) is the tendency to find uncertainty distressing. IU is related to anxiety in adults and youth but it is unclear whether IU plays a maintenance or causal role, particularly across childhood. Our research examined whether: (1) IU is associated with generalised anxiety in preschool-aged children; (2) IU in preschool-aged children is associated with the trajectory of generalised anxiety into middle childhood; and (3) IU is associated with the trajectory of internalising symptoms and externalising symptoms over time. Parents completed questionnaires (child anxiety, IU, internalising and externalising symptoms) about their children at three timepoints when their child was: 3–4 years old (n = 180); 5–7 years old (n = 162); and 8–10 years old (n = 148). Those with higher IU had higher concurrent generalised anxiety, internalising and externalising symptoms at each measurement point. Preschoolers with higher IU, relative to lower IU, had, on average, higher generalised anxiety across childhood. Unexpectedly though, children who were higher in IU as preschoolers were more likely to show a decrease in generalised anxiety over time. These findings indicate that IU is a consistent correlate of generalised anxiety, internalising and externalising symptoms, but that it may not play a causal role in the onset of generalised anxiety in children.
