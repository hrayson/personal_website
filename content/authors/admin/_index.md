I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Hôpital Femme Mère Enfant and Institut des Sciences - (CNRS) in Lyon. The main focus of my research is on neurocognitive development underlying social perception and social interaction, as well as the effects of early social experience on socio-cognitive and affective functioning. I use multimodal techniques including electroencephalography (EEG), eye-tracking, behavioural observation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), longitudinal research designs, and advanced statistical methods.
