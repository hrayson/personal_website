I am a Postdoctoral Researcher, Research Project Manager, and Clinical Psychologist, based in Lyon, France. I am affiliated with the Institut des Sciences Cognitives – Marc Jeannerod (CNRS), the Hôpital Femme Mère Enfant, and CHU Clermont-Ferrand.

My research focuses on the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying social perception and social interaction across early development, and on how early social experience—including adversity and parental psychopathology—shapes socio-cognitive and affective functioning. I adopt a developmental and mechanistic perspective, investigating how attentional, perceptual, and learning processes emerge and reorganise across infancy, and how these processes contribute to risk and resilience for later mental health outcomes.

Methodologically, my work relies on longitudinal, multimodal approaches combining electroencephalography (EEG), eye-tracking, behavioural observation, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), together with advanced statistical and computational analyses. Through this work, I aim to bridge developmental cognitive neuroscience, social development, and clinical psychology, with the goal of identifying early, experience-sensitive mechanisms relevant to prevention and intervention.
